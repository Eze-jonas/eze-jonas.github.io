<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Data Science / Machine Learning / Data Engineering</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning (CNN)</strong><br/>
    <p>
      Built a sentiment classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow to analyze customer review summaries from the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset. The goal was to leverage customer feedback to improve and maintain the quality of goods and services. A hybrid pipeline combining PySpark and native Python was used for preprocessing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization of short text data. The model achieved strong and consistent performance (Test Accuracy: 86.8%, AUC: 97.0%) and was deployed interactively in Databricks using widgets. Final predictions were stored in a Delta Lake SQL table for querying. Model choice prioritized computational efficiency due to hardware limitations, favoring CNN over LSTM or transformer-based alternatives

    <strong>Tools used:</strong><br/>
<strong>Languages & Frameworks:</strong> Python, SQL, TensorFlow, Keras<br/>
<strong>Big Data & Processing:</strong> PySpark, Databricks, Delta Lake<br/>
<strong>Deployment & Utilities:</strong> joblib, Databricks Widgets<br/>

    <strong>Credit Card Eligibility Prediction</strong><br/>
    <p>
      This project aimed to reduce the time taken to manually process credit card applications and minimize human errors and biases by automating eligibility decisions using machine learning. Predictive models were developed using traditional algorithms (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) as well as a deep learning approach (Artificial Neural Network). Feature selection techniques, including Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were applied to improve model performance. Among the tested methods, the Decision Tree model using GA-selected features showed the best results.

The final model was deployed via a RESTful API built with Flask, featuring an interactive web form enhanced with JavaScript and CSS, and hosted on the cloud using Render. This work demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to financial services and provides a foundation for more advanced, scalable credit eligibility systems.

<h3>Data Analytics / Business Intelligence / Dashboards</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Multi-Dashboard Sales & Profitability Analysis (2014–2017)</strong><br/>
    Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize regional sales, profitability, and customer segments from 2014–2017. Insights helped identify key revenue drivers and underperforming areas.<br/>
    <strong>Tools used:</strong> Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, DAX<br/>
